## The Problem

Your model is experiencing what's called "mode collapse" - it's learning to minimize loss without actually learning proper spatial movement patterns. Here's what I found:

### 1. **Coordinate Normalization Issues**
- **Training**: Cursor coordinates are normalized to [0,1] range by dividing by 512/384 in <mcfile name="dataset.py" path="d:\osu ai replay maker test\src\data\dataset.py"></mcfile>
- **Generation**: The model outputs are converted using `tanh` ([-1,1]) then scaled to screen coordinates in <mcfile name="sampling.py" path="d:\osu ai replay maker test\src\generation\sampling.py"></mcfile>
- **Beatmap Objects**: Also normalized to [0,1] range in <mcfile name="generator.py" path="d:\osu ai replay maker test\src\generation\generator.py"></mcfile>

### 2. **Constrained Movement Pattern**
The analysis shows:
- Cursor movement confined to ~350-500 X, 200-380 Y (small area)
- Very low average velocity (1.35 pixels/step)
- Good timing patterns (705 presses, 6.72ms average duration)
- But poor spatial exploration

### 3. **Beatmap Analysis**
The testmap.osu has objects distributed across the full playfield (0-512, 0-384), so the issue isn't with the input data.

## Root Causes

1. **Loss Function**: Likely not penalizing unrealistic movement patterns
2. **Model Architecture**: May be bottlenecking spatial information
3. **Coordinate Scaling**: Mismatch between training normalization and generation scaling
4. **Temporary Scaling Fix**: The 150x scaling factor in generator suggests the model outputs are too small

## Recommended Fixes

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Fix Coordinate Consistency**: Ensure training and generation use the same normalization scheme
2. **Add Spatial Diversity Loss**: Penalize repetitive movement patterns
3. **Review Model Architecture**: Check if spatial encoding layers are sufficient
4. **Remove Temporary Scaling**: The 150x multiplier is masking the real issue

### Investigation Priority:
1. Check if training data has similar spatial constraints
2. Examine loss function implementation
3. Analyze model's spatial encoding capabilities
4. Verify data preprocessing pipeline

The model is learning timing correctly but failing to learn proper spatial movement dynamics, which is why validation metrics look good but actual output is poor.
